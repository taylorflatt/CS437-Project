			<p>The program was developed by Taylor Flatt for a CS 437 Machine Learning project. It is programmed in C#.</p>

			<p>To view specifics on each step, you may view the following files:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="startpage.htm">Start Page</a></li>
				<li><a href="datainputpage.htm">Data Input Page</a></li>
				<li><a href="dataoutputpage.htm">Data Output Page</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The plan is to continue to implement the various components of the k-NN algorithm such as cross-validation and the ability to handle discrete data.</p>

			<p>The program makes several assumptions in order for it to work. All of which I think are reasonable assumptions and easy to work with.

			<ul>
				<li><u>Assumption 1</u>: I assume an excel spreadsheet (*.xlsx).</li>
				<li><u>Assumption 2</u>: I assume that the first row of the spreadsheet are the descriptors of the data. </li>
				<li><u>Assumption 3</u>: I assume that the first column represents the output class (name) of the data point.</li>
				<li><u>Assumption 4</u>: I assume that the second column represents the data point label.</li>
				<li><u>Assumption 5</u>: I assume all attribute data is continous data.</li>
				<li><u>Assumption 6</u>: I assume (for now) that you are able to determine a k value and enter it into the application.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

			<p>I have a list of cars from 5 different manufacturers. I want to know if I develop a car, who my closest manufacturing competitor will be. So I know that there are a few attributes that really influence the competitiveness of a car.</p>

			<p>For instance, the average MPG, fuel capacity, # of options, sale (MSRP) price, and horsepower are all attributes that would put my car in competition with another car. So I have a list of those manufacturers with all their cars with those attributes put in and I run the k-NN algorithm with my car as the input to determine the closest manufacturer to me.</p>

			<p>In that case, my classes are the manufacturers (Example: Dodge). My data point label were the model of the cars (Example: Charger). My attributes are the average MPG, fuel capacity, # of options, sale price, and horsepower.</p>
