			<p>Although this help file attempts to be as comprehensive (thereby inclusive) as possible, there are just some things that are good sources that should be mentioned for further reading.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>(Recommended)</strong> <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~tinoosh/cmpe650/slides/K_Nearest_Neighbor_Algorithm.pdf">Tinoosh Mohsenin</a>. This is probably the most exhaustive look at k-NN there is. The pdf looks at every facet of the algorithm and a systematic approach on how to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.</li>
				<li><a href="https://class.coursera.org/machlearning-001/lecture">CourseA Machine Learning</a>. This is a good source of videos by a fantastic lecturer. Among other things he talks in detail about the k-NN algorithm in the week four "instance-based learning". </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/">Analytics Vidhya</a>. This is a nice gentle introduction to the k-NN algorithm with a brief overview of its function and attributes.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/k-nearest-neighbors">Stat Soft</a>. They provide an overview of the k-NN algorithm much like Analytics Vidhya but it is much more detailed and include a much more mathematical approach to the algorithm.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.saedsayad.com/k_nearest_neighbors.htm">Saed Sayad</a>. There is a general look at k-NN with a good example and explanation of handling discrete measurements with Hamming Distance. Although, it should be noted that VDM is a better choice usually.</li>
