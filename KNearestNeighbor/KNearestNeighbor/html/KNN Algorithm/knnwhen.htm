			<p>The k-NN algorithm can be used for both regression predictive problems as well as classification. However, it is most notably used for classification. Classification is a much more applicable situation in the real world. Typically problems require a decision to be made such as "which group of people do we target for our ad campaign?". These kinds of problems require an answer and k-NN can provide that answer.</p>

			<p>The algorithm itself is very easy to understand, use, and implement. On top of that, it is fairly competitive in calculation and results. That makes k-NN an obvious choice for consideration for a classification problem. It should be one of the first choices for a classification data study when there is little or no prior knowledge about the distributiono of the data.</p>
